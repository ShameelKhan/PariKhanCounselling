<h3>Some Information On What You May Expect From Your Sessions</h3>

<p>Each session lasts fifty minutes and costs Â£45. This is on a one-to-one basis for adult individuals.

The initial meeting will usually be a little different in that I will generally ask more questions about your past and current situation. This is only to give me a general picture of your circumstances so that we can look at what may be helpful for you. We would also discuss your expectations and what you hope to achieve from counselling. By the end of the first session you will have the opportunity to decide whether you would like to come back for further ones. Please remember that you are under no obligation to do so.

If you opt to continue, subsequent sessions will often be led by what you would like to talk about, with me offering you my feedback in what I hope would be in a non-judgemental atmosphere of trust. Therapy is very much a collaborative exercise between counsellor and client and as the sessions go on we will regularly review how you feel your therapy is progressing.</p>
